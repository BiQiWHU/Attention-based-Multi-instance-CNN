# Attention-based-Multi-instance-CNN
Spatial/Channel-spatial attention based multi-instance CNN for image classification

# brief introduction
The combination of multiple instance learning and ConvNets in a trainable manner, also known as deep MIL, has drawn increasing attention in the past few years.

In the past few years, we have studied deep MIL and explored a variety of solutions to adapt MIL into existing ConvNets.

This Github project is a summarization of our former works, and we provided three types of MI-CNN on the backbone of: (1) our designed light-weight DenseNet structure, (2) AlexNet with pre-trained parameters on ImageNet, and (3) VGG-16 with pre-trained parameters on ImageNet.
